## This is the privacyIDEA PHP Client

This library will help you to connect your plugin to the privacyIDEA server using REST APIs.

## Requirements

To use our client lib you have to install curl on your machine. If you have installed our client
with Composer you don't need to think about it, because Composer will do it for you automatically.
To avoid bugs we also advise you to install PHP >=7.3.

To install our repository with Composer, run this command in Terminal:
